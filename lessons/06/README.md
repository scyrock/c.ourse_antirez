# Lesson 6: if, goto, while, recursion  [:video_camera:](https://youtu.be/lc7aYXNl1T8?si=zZPHeBqnIrOfynSe)

This lesson explores program conditional statements, block, and different approaches to repetitive execution in C programming.

## Variable Scope and Memory
- **`block.c`** - Code blocks with curly brackets, variable scope rules, memory addresses, and variable lifetime within blocks.

## Conditional Statements
- **`if.c`** - If-else statements, condition evaluation, and block syntax

## Loop Constructs
- **`loop.c`** - Labels and goto statements, while loops, and loop implementations using different approaches.

## Recursive Functions
- **`recursion.c`** - Function recursion and memory allocation in recursive calls.
