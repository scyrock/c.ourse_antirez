# Lesson 21: Unions and Bitfields [:video_camera:](https://youtu.be/TM4jgODgdFY?si=o1Rnv2ZuYNAfHoEQ)

This lesson demonstrates advanced structure features in C, showing how to share memory between different data types using unions and how to optimize memory usage through bitfields.

## Unions and Shared Memory
- **`union.c`** - Union usage for sharing memory between different data types, showing how multiple fields can occupy the same memory location for flexible data representation.

## Bitfields and Memory Optimization
- **`bitfield.c`** - Bitfield implementation for fine-grained memory control, demonstrating bit-level field sizing, memory optimization, and wrapping behavior for unsigned types.
