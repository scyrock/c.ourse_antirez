# Lesson 10: Pointer Operations [:video_camera:](https://youtu.be/lc7hL9Wt-ho?si=hBjniu4dzTZvY-st)

This lesson explores pointer concepts in C programming, demonstrating pointer arithmetic, multi-level pointers, and string manipulation through pointers.

## Dereferencing and Function Parameters
- **`pointer1.c`** - Dereferencing operations, accessing variables through memory addresses, and read/write operations using pointer parameters.

## Pointer Arithmetic and Multi-level Pointers
- **`pointer2.c`** - Pointer to pointer declarations, pointer arithmetic operations, type casting with pointers, string manipulation, and memory address calculations with different data types.

## String Processing with Pointers
- **`pointer3.c`** - Custom string processing functions.
