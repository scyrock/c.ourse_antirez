# Lesson 7: while, for and switch [:video_camera:](https://youtu.be/HCRthhjbfAg?si=d9Tq9i7Q-x4pmVUy)

This lesson explores different loop constructs and control flow mechanisms in C programming.

## Loop Constructs
- **`loop.c`** - While loops, for loops with various configurations, array iteration, and loop control with break statements.

## Do-While Loops
- **`dowhile.c`** - Do-while loop execution, condition checking after block execution.

## Switch Statements
- **`switch.c`** - Switch-case statements, fall-through behavior, break statements, and variable declaration within switch blocks.

## Recursive Functions
- **`recursion.c`** - Function recursion, tail recursion optimization using goto, and memory efficiency in recursive implementations.
