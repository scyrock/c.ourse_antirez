# Lesson 8: Game of Life [:video_camera:](https://youtu.be/c5atNuYdKK8?si=9Bju6ChXmWvCu9Yu)

In this lesson the arguments explained in the previous lecture are exploited to implement the Game of Life, showcasing arrays, function design, and modular programming. Moreover this lesson demonstrates an example of how to structure C code by creating basic functions to specialize code first, then combining these functions to solve complex problems.

## Preprocessor Directives, Array Management
- **`life.c`** - #define macros for constants, preprocessor variable substitution, two-dimensional grid representation, pointer-based array modification, and coordinate-to-index conversion functions.
