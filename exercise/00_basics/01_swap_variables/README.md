# Swap Variables
Given two integer variables, swap their values without using a third variable and print the values before and after swapping.
You must swap the values using only the two original variables, no additional variables allowed.

*Example*
```
Before swapping: a = 5, b = 10
After swapping: a = 10, b = 5
```
